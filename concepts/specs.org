* Economy
** Start with 5
** Platforms cost 4, 8, 16, 32, 64... powers of 2
** Each shot costs 1
*** This never prevents from shooting, just goes into negative if needed
** Each kill gives 3
** So the bank at the start of the game is as follows:
   - New game                   5
   - Build a platform           1
   - First shot                 0
   - (The shot connects)        3
   - Continue shooting          5, 7, 9
   - Build the second platform  1
